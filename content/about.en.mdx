## My Journey in Web Development

I embarked on my web development journey in 2021, diving into the waters of HTML and CSS. Gradually, I explored the wonders of JavaScript for front-end development and even delved headfirst into the tumultuous realm of Node.js. In 2022, I ventured into Next.js and React, which became my go-to companions for web development.

My heart particularly resonates with crafting static websites. I love using Next.js to build performant and responsive websites, adding a touch of interactivity by employing MDX to integrate dynamic content into my static pages.

My web development skills are a harmonious blend of HTML, CSS (I particularly enjoy working with SASS for more elegant styles), and JavaScript. My experience with JavaScript is broad and diverse, ranging from frameworks and packages to mastering Node.js. But I don't stop there – I've also embraced TypeScript for a more robust approach.

In the fascinating world of front-end web development, I'm well-versed in design, utilizing Figma to breathe life into my creative ideas. ✨

## My Open Source Contributions <FaOsi />

I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and open source. I've had the privilege of contributing to various open source projects, each offering its own dose of learning and enrichment. Some of my significant contributions include:

- Node.js <FaNodeJs />:
  - Since August 2022, I've contributed to the translation of Node.js, helping make this essential resource accessible to a broader audience.
  - Starting from October 2022, I've been hands-on with the Node.js website, even participating in its redesign using React. This experience delved me deeper into the world of front-end development.
  - I've also had the opportunity to join the Next-10 team, where I've taken part in the ongoing i18n documentation initiative as well as the upcoming/relaunching examples initiative.
  - Alongside, I've contributed by fixing various issues and enhancing projects, showcasing my dedication to the community.
  - I've also been nominated to join the Node.js website team, enabling me to contribute actively to the Node.js website.

I'm passionate about the idea of contributing to the core of Node.js runtime in the future, as I believe that's where I can make a meaningful and lasting impact.

# Version Control Skills <FaCodeBranch />

As a staunch advocate of open source, I've developed strong version control skills with Git and collaboration on GitHub. I'm comfortable with concepts like branches, commits, pull requests, and merging, enabling me to work effectively in teams and contribute to open source projects seamlessly.

I'm accustomed to using Git to track my own projects and actively participate in discussions and code reviews on GitHub. Effective version management is a crucial aspect of my development approach, ensuring traceability and smooth collaboration.

## Educational Background

My academic journey saw me primarily exploring mathematics until I excitingly pivoted towards computer science. My native language is French, but I'm also proficient in English (B2 level) and have a foundation in Dutch (A2 level).

### My Degrees <FaGraduationCap />

- Certificate of Basic Education (CEB)
- Certificate of Studies for the 1st Degree (CE1D)
- Certificate of Studies for the 2nd Degree of Secondary Education (CE2D)

I'm enthusiastic about continuing to broaden my horizons in web development, science, and contributing to the creation of engaging and innovative online experiences. Let's connect and collaborate to bring great ideas to life! 🚀

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of web development and open source contributions, I lead a fulfilling life! I'm a passionate gamer and love diving into virtual worlds, whether it's coding datapacks and bots in JavaScript for Minecraft or playing titles like Assassin's Creed, Forza, and CS:GO.

When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, I enjoy tinkering with electronic projects. I've created an LED strip connected with Apple HomeKit using Arduino, merging technology and creativity.

Lastly, I'm also passionate about video editing. I've gained strong skills working with Final Cut Pro X, creating captivating and impactful videos.

Another of my great interests is music. I'm a huge fan of Rammstein and was incredibly lucky to attend one of their concerts in Brussels on 05/08/2023.

I also love listening to music, and I have a Spotify playlist that follows me wherever I go.
