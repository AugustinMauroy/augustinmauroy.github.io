## My Web Development Journey

I started my web development learning journey in 2021 by diving into HTML and CSS. Later, I explored the wonders of JavaScript for front-end development and even dove headfirst into the tumultuous waters of Node.js. In 2022, I ventured towards Next.js and React, which have become my preferred companions for web development.

My heart particularly beats for creating static websites. I love using Next.js to build performant and responsive websites, and I add a touch of interactivity by using MDX to integrate dynamic content into my static pages.

My web development skills are a harmonious blend of HTML, CSS (I especially enjoy working with tailwindcss), and JavaScript. My experience with JavaScript is vast and diverse, ranging from frameworks and packages to mastering Node.js. However, I don't stop there; I've also adopted TypeScript for a more robust approach.

In the fascinating universe of front-end web development, I'm well-versed in design and use Figma to bring my creative ideas to life. ‚ú®

## My Open Source Contributions <FaOsi />

I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and open source. I've had the privilege of contributing to various open source projects, each providing its own share of learning and enrichment. Among my most significant contributions:

- Node.js:
  - Since August 2022, I've contributed to Node.js translation, helping make this essential resource accessible to a wider audience.
  - Starting in October 2022, I rolled up my sleeves for the Node.js website, even participating in the site's redesign using React. This experience allowed me to dive deeper into the world of front-end development.
  - I also had the opportunity to join the Next-10 team, where I participated in the ongoing i18n documentation initiative and the examples initiative that is about to be launched/relaunched.
  - In parallel, I've contributed to resolving various issues and making improvements to projects, demonstrating my commitment to the community.
  - In late August 2023, I was nominated to the Node.js website team, allowing me to actively contribute to the Node.js website.
  - In March 2024, the website team finished the redesign of the Node.js website, which allowed me to contribute to the Node.js website redesign. [Here's a post on the website redesign](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign)

I'm passionate about the idea of contributing to the very core of the Node.js runtime in the future, as I believe that's where I could make a significant and lasting contribution.

# Version Control Skills <FaCodeBranch />

As an avid open source advocate, I've developed strong version control skills using Git and collaborating on GitHub. I'm comfortable with branching, committing, pull requests, and merging concepts, enabling me to work efficiently in a team and contribute to open source projects smoothly.

I'm accustomed to using Git to track my own projects and actively participate in discussions and code reviews on GitHub. Effective version control is a crucial aspect of my development approach, ensuring traceability and harmonious collaboration.

## My Academic Journey

My academic path has primarily explored mathematics until I made an exciting pivot towards computer science. My native language is French, but I'm also proficient in English (B2 level) and have basic knowledge of Dutch (A2 level).

### My Diplomas <FaGraduationCap />

- Certificate of Basic Education (CEB)
- Certificate of the First Degree of Secondary Education (CE1D)
- Certificate of the Second Degree of Secondary Education (CE2D)

I'm enthusiastic about continuing to broaden my horizons in the web development and science fields and contributing to creating engaging and innovative online experiences. Let's connect and collaborate to bring great (and surely the wackiest) ideas to life! üöÄ

## My Passions and Hobbies

Outside of web development and open source contributions, I have a busy life! I'm a video game enthusiast and love diving into virtual worlds, whether in Minecraft where I code datapacks and bots in JavaScript, or in titles like Assassin's Creed, Forza, and CS:GO.

When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I enjoy tinkering with electronic projects. I've created an Apple HomeKit-connected LED strip using Arduino, allowing me to marry technology and creativity.

Another of my great interests is music. I'm an avid fan of Rammstein, and I had the incredible chance to attend one of their concerts in Brussels on 05/08/2023.

I also love listening to music, and I have a Spotify playlist that goes with me everywhere.
