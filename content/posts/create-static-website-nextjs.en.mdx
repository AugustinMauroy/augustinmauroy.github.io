You may have already heard of Next.js, a React framework for building web applications. But did you know that you can also create static websites with Next.js? In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a static website with Next.js and MDX, and we will deploy it using GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of React.
- Understanding of the difference between client-side rendering and server-side rendering.
- Next.js 13
- React 18
- Node.js 18

## What is a static website?

A static website is a website whose content is fixed, meaning that the content does not change based on the user. For example, a static website can be a blog, a portfolio, a showcase website, etc.

However, it can be generated dynamically, which means that the content is generated in advance and is stored in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. That's what we'll explore in this tutorial.

## Project Creation

To get started, we will create a Next.js project. To do this, we will use the following command:"

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

A CLI will then open and ask you to choose a name for your project. You can choose any name you like. For me, I chose 'nextjs-mdx-blog.'

Next, it will ask you if you want to use TypeScript. You can choose 'yes' to use TypeScript or 'no' to use JavaScript. I chose 'yes' because TypeScript allows me to better type my code and, by extension, make it more robust.

Finally, it will ask if you want to use ESLint. You can choose 'yes' to use ESLint or 'no' to not use it. I chose 'yes' because ESLint is a great linter and helps maintain consistent code. It's up to you whether you want to use ESLint or not, but I recommend using it because it makes your code cleaner and more readable. There are also code formatters like Prettier that can make your code more readable.

Afterward, it will offer to use Tailwind CSS. I strongly advise against using Tailwind CSS as it doesn't contribute to a good developer experience with its 'class coding.' In our case, we will use Next.js CSS modules.

Finally, it will suggest using import aliases. I recommend using them as they make your code more readable.

Installing Dependencies

We will use other dependencies for our project. To do this, we will use the following command:

```bash
npm install sass next-themes next-mdx-remote
```

You can also install `react-icons` if you want to use icons in your project. I encourage you to check out the [documentation](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) for more information.

## Configuring Next.js

To start, we will configure Next.js. To do this, we will modify the `next.config.js` file at the root of our project. We will rename it to `next.config.mjs` to use ES modules.

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
	output: 'export',
	images: { unoptimized: true },
	trailingSlash: false,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## Creating Folders and Files

### `content` Directory

This is where you can store the content of your pages. It can be in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format, allowing you to write React code within Markdown. This avoids the need to write JSX to create a page.

For metadata, I use the [YAML](https://yaml.org) format, but you can use any format you prefer to store metadata.

For example, the [project](/project) page on my site is based on a YAML file, while the [about](/about) page is based on MDX.

### `src/app` Directory

In this directory, you will create `page.tsx` files for defined URLs like `/about` or `/contact`. To do this, create a `page.tsx` file in the "about" directory to create the `/about` page.

As mentioned earlier, we want to write our content in MDX, so we will need a `page.tsx` that allows us to lay out our pages. However, you can also use plain JSX if Markdown is not needed, as on my [homepage](/).

### Other Standard Folders

In addition to the mentioned directories above, you can use folders such as `src/components`, `src/styles`, and `src/utils` to organize your code in a clean and modular way.

### How to Retrieve Data for Pages

As mentioned earlier, we want to write pages in Markdown or other file formats. To achieve this, we will use Next.js React Server Components (RSC).

For this, we'll need a small piece of code that I've written (if you want to support me for this code, follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/augustinmauroy)).

`getContent.tsx`:

```tsx
import fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';

const basePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content');

function getContentBySlug(
	slug: string,
	lang: string,
	ext: string = 'mdx',
): string | undefined {
	try {
		const filePath = path.join(basePath, `${slug}.${lang}.${ext}`);
		return fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
	} catch (e) {
		try {
			const defaultFilePath = path.join(basePath, `${slug}.en.${ext}`);
			return fs.readFileSync(defaultFilePath, 'utf8');
		} catch (e) {
			return undefined;
		}
	}
}
```

### How to Create a Page

To create a page, you need to create a `page.tsx` file in the `src/app` directory and add the following code:
In this example, the language is set to English and is not changeable because this tutorial does not cover localization (i18n).

```tsx
import { compileMDX } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc';
import { getContentBySlug } from '@/lib/getcontent';
import ArticleLayout from '@/components/layouts/article';
import type { FC } from 'react';
import type { Metadata } from 'next';

const generateMetadata = async (): Promise<Metadata> => {
	const rawContent = getContentBySlug('about', 'en');

	if (!rawContent) {
		return {
			title: '404',
		};
	}

	const { frontmatter } = await compileMDX<{
		title: string;
		description: string;
	}>({
		source: rawContent,
		options: { parseFrontmatter: true },
	});

	return {
		title: frontmatter.title,
		description: frontmatter.description,
	};
};

const Page: FC = async () => {
	const rawContent = getContentBySlug('about', 'en');

	if (!rawContent) return null;

	const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX<{
		title: string;
		description: string;
	}>({
		source: rawContent,
		options: { parseFrontmatter: true },
	});

	return (
		<ArticleLayout
			title={frontmatter.title}
			description={frontmatter.description}
		>
			{content}
		</ArticleLayout>
	);
};

export { generateMetadata };
export default Page;
```

### Creating a Dynamic Page

To create a dynamic page, you need to create a file `src/app/path/[slug]/page.tsx`.

For the dynamic aspect of the page, you need to generate the [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#generating-static-params).

The `generateStaticParams` function looks like this (in this case, it generates all the slugs for my blog):

```tsx
const generateStaticParams = () => {
	const slugs = getAllSlugs('posts');
	return slugs.map((data) => ({
		slug: data.slug,
	}));
};
```

Let's look at how `getAllSlugs` is done:

```tsx
function getAllSlugs(dir: string): AllSlug[] {
	const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join(basePath, dir));
	const slugs = files.map((file) => {
		const slug = file.replace('.mdx', '');
		return slug;
	});
	const allSlugs: AllSlug[] = [];
	slugs.forEach((slug) => {
		const lang = slug.split('.')[1];
		const slugName = slug.split('.')[0];
		const allSlug: AllSlug = {
			slug: slugName,
			lang,
		};
		if (lang === undefined || slug === undefined) return;
		allSlugs.push(allSlug);
	});
	return allSlugs;
}
```

Next, to make the page dynamic, you need the page itself.

Here's how to use these static params:

```tsx
type PageProps = {
	params: BlogParams;
};

const Page: FC<PageProps> = async ({ params }) => {
	const rawContent = getContentBySlug(`posts/${params.slug}`, params.lang);

	if (!rawContent) return notFound();

	const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX<BlogFrontMatter>({
		source: rawContent,
		components: MDXComponents,
		options: { parseFrontmatter: true },
	});

	const authors = frontmatter.authors.split(',').map((author) => author.trim());

	return (
		<BlogPostLayout
			title={frontmatter.title}
			description={frontmatter.description}
			date={frontmatter.date}
			authors={authors}
			thumbnail={frontmatter.thumbnail}
		>
			{content}
		</BlogPostLayout>
	);
};
```

### Deploying the Site

To do this, we use a GitHub action that deploys the site to GitHub Pages.

Here is the code for the action:

It assumes that the project is on npm and that you are using [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build for GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Git Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
          cache: npm

      - name: Install NPM packages
        run: npm ci

      - name: Setup GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Restore Cache
        uses: actions/cache/restore@v3
        with:
          path: |
            .next/cache
            node_modules/.cache
          key: build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-
          restore-keys: |
            build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-
          enableCrossOsArchive: true

      - name: Build Next.js
        run: npx turbo build

      - name: Save Cache
        uses: actions/cache/save@v3
        with:
          path: |
            .next/cache
            node_modules/.cache
          key: build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-${{ hashFiles('node_modules/.cache') }}
          enableCrossOsArchive: true

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: out

  deploy:
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```
