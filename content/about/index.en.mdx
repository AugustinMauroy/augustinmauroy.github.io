## My Journey in Web Development

I started learning web development in 2021 by diving into HTML and CSS. Later, I discovered the wonders of JavaScript for front-end development and even dove headfirst into the turbulent waters of Node.js. In 2022, I ventured into Next.js and React, which have become my favorite companions for web development.

My heart particularly beats for creating static websites. I love using Next.js to build performant and reactive sites, and I add a touch of interactivity by using MDX to integrate dynamic content into my static pages.

My web development skills are a mix of HTML, CSS (I particularly enjoy working with TailwindCSS), and JavaScript. My experience with JavaScript is vast and diverse, ranging from frameworks and packages to mastering Node.js. But I don't stop there; I've also adopted TypeScript for a more robust approach.

In the fascinating universe of front-end web development, I'm also skilled in design and use Figma to bring my creative ideas to life. ✨

## My Open Source Contributions

I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and open source. I've had the privilege of contributing to various open source projects, each bringing its share of learning and enrichment. Among my most significant contributions:

### Node.js

## Other Skills

In addition to my web development skills, I have a solid foundation in Git, Docker, and CI/CD. I've used these tools to streamline my development workflow and ensure my projects are always up-to-date and running smoothly.

## My Academic Journey

My academic journey has primarily explored mathematics and sciences until I made an exciting turn towards computer science. My native language is French, but I'm also proficient in English (B2 level) and have basic knowledge of Dutch (A1 level).

### My Diplomas

- Certificate of Basic Education (CEB)
- Certificate of the First Degree of Secondary Education (CE1D)
- Certificate of the Second Degree of Secondary Education (CE2D)

I'm excited to continue expanding my horizons in the fields of web development and science, and to contribute to creating engaging and innovative online experiences. Let's connect and collaborate to bring great (and surely the craziest) ideas to life! 🚀

## My Passions and Hobbies

Outside of web development and open source contributions, I have a full life! I'm a passionate gamer and love diving into virtual worlds, whether it's in Minecraft where I code datapacks and bots in JavaScript, or in titles like Assassin's Creed, Forza, and CS:GO.

When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I enjoy tinkering with electronics projects. I created an LED strip connected to Apple HomeKit using Arduino, which allows me to combine technology and creativity.

      Another one of my great passions is music. I'm a huge fan of Rammstein,
      and I had the incredible opportunity to attend one of their concerts in
      Brussels on 05/08/2023. And on 27/06/2024, I had the chance to attend
      another concert in Ostend. I also love listening to music, and I have a
      Spotify playlist that goes everywhere with me.
