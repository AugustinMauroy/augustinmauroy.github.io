description: Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Augustin Mauroy, a student and developer devoted to the JavaScript ecosystem.

I'm also a strong advocate for Open Source and I love contributing to projects that resonate with me in my work.

### My Open Source contributions

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that I've been using for a few years now. I've had the opportunity to contribute to this project. For example, I contributed to translating the Node.js website into French, which was an enriching experience. I then worked on the Node.js "website-redesign" initiative, which aims to modernize the Node.js website.
I had the opportunity to participate in the "Node.js collab summit" in November 2024 in Dublin, where I was able to meet other contributors and exchange ideas about best development practices. It was an incredible experience to be able to discuss with people passionate about the same subject as me.
After that, I joined the brand new "userland-migration" initiative which aims to help Node.js users migrate to the latest version of Node.js.

The JavaScript ecosystem is powerful thanks to its numerous packages but the npm registry is getting a bit outdated. When Deno opened its package registry to the public, I decided to contribute for example UX, UI and some small functionality to this registry. It's [JSR](https://jsr.io), for the curious or just those who want to know more.

Testing React components can be boring and complicated when using Jest, which is why I tried using [`node:test` aka node test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) to test my React components. But there needed to be a way to import `tsx`, `png`, `css` files... That's how I discovered [`nodejs-loaders/nodejs-loader`](https://github.com/nodejs-loaders/nodejs-loader) a package that contains several ESM loaders for Node.js initially written by [Jacob Smith](https://github.com/JakobJingleheimer). And I contributed to it to make it better. That's how I became co-maintainer of this package.

## My tools (stack)

I mainly use Node.js and React for my projects. I also like to use TypeScript to add a layer of security to my code. React alone can be complicated to create a complete app, which is why I also use Next.js to create web applications. I also like to use Tailwind CSS to style my applications, as it allows me to create elegant and responsive user interfaces quickly. And for data storage, I often use PostgreSQL with Prisma.

For solid development, I use [BiomeJS](https://biomejs.dev) to lint and format my code. And GitHub to host my projects and collaborate with other developers. I also use GitHub Actions to automate my development workflows, like testing and deploying my applications...

## My passions

Besides all this Open Source part, I also have other passions. I really love music and video games.

And on 27/06/2024, I had the opportunity to attend another concert in Ostend. I also love listening to music, and I have a Spotify playlist that accompanies me everywhere."
