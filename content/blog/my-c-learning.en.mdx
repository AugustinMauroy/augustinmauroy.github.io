## Why is C Important?

The C language is a popular and widely used programming language in system software development, device drivers, video games, and embedded applications. It is known for its performance, portability, and flexibility. Learning C is an excellent way to understand fundamental programming concepts and become a better developer.

## First Program

The first program I wrote in C was the famous "Hello, World!". This program is a classic for starting with any programming language.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

## Variables

After understanding how to write a simple program, I learned to manipulate variables. Variables are containers for storing data.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'J';

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.1f\n", height);
    printf("Initial: %c\n", initial);

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

### Data Types

The C language supports different data types, such as integers, floats, characters, and strings.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Size (in bytes)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>int</code></td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>float</code></td>
      <td>Float</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>double</code></td>
      <td>Double Float</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>char</code></td>
      <td>Character</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>char[]</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Variable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>void</code></td>
      <td>Void</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Conditional Structures

Conditional structures, such as `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements, allow you to make decisions in a program.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int number = 10;

    if (number > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
    } else if (number < 0) {
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The number is zero.\n");
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

## Iterative Structures

Iterative structures, such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, allow you to repeat blocks of code.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }

    int j = 0;
    while (j < 5) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", j);
        j++;
    }

    int k = 0;
    do {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", k);
        k++;
    } while (k < 5);

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

## Arrays

Arrays are collections of data of the same type. I learned to declare, initialize, and access elements of an array.

You can declare an array as follows:

```c
int numbers[5];
```

You can initialize an array as follows:

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

You can access the elements of an array as follows:

```c
printf("Element 0: %d\n", numbers[0]);
```

> **Note**: Array indices start at 0.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Element %d: %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

### Getting the Size of an Array

To get the size of an array, you can divide the total size of the array by the size of one element of the array.

```c
int size = sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(numbers[0]);
```

## Sorting

I learned to sort arrays using sorting algorithms like bubble sort.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main(void) {
    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);

    bubbleSort(arr, n);

    printf("Sorted array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

## String Manipulation

String manipulation is essential for many applications. I learned to use functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char str1[50] = "Hello";
    char str2[50] = "World";
    char str3[50];

    strcpy(str3, str1);
    strcat(str3, " ");
    strcat(str3, str2);

    printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", str3);
    printf("String length: %lu\n", strlen(str3));

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

## Files

File manipulation is a common task in programming. I learned to read and write files using sequential access and direct access.

### Creating a `FILE` Type Variable

To manipulate files in C, you use a variable of type `FILE`. This variable is actually a pointer to a structure that contains information about the file. To create a `FILE` type variable, you use the `fopen` function with the following arguments:

- `filename`: the name of the file.
- `mode`: the opening mode (`r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`, `w+`, `a+`).
  - `r`: read.
  - `w`: write (creates a new file or overwrites the existing file).
  - `a`: append (writes at the end of the file).
  - `r+`: read and write (the file must exist).
  - `w+`: read and write (creates a new file or overwrites the existing file).
  - `a+`: read and append (writes at the end of the file).

Adding the `b` symbol at the end of the opening mode allows you to open the file in binary mode.

### Pointers

A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable. In C, pointers are used to manipulate memory directly and to pass references to functions. In the context of files, a pointer of type `FILE` is used to reference an open file.

### Sequential Access

Sequential access allows you to read or write files linearly.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening the file.\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    fprintf(file, "Hello, world!\n");
    fclose(file);

    file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening the file.\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    char buffer[100];
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file)) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }

    fclose(file);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

### Direct Access

Direct access allows you to read or write files at specific positions.

<details>
<summary>View the code</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w+");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening the file.\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    fputs("Hello, world!\n", file);
    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET);

    char buffer[100];
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file);
    printf("%s", buffer);

    fclose(file);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

</details>

### Positioning in a File

The `fseek` function allows you to move to a specific position in a file. You can move from the beginning, the end, or the current position. To do this, you use the `fseek` function with the following arguments:

- `file`: the pointer to the file.
- `offset`: the offset from the starting position.
- `whence`: the starting position (`SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_CUR`, or `SEEK_END`).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Starting Position</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SEEK_SET</code></td>
      <td>Beginning of the file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SEEK_CUR</code></td>
      <td>Current position</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SEEK_END</code></td>
      <td>End of the file</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
